# AWS Lambda Provisioning and Deployment

## This code was part of my Pre-Screen interview for an Automation Engineer Role

```text

Yes ðŸ˜Š, I got the opportunity, and now, two years down the line, I am reflecting on how I should have used a different approach to provision and deploy the assignment.

```

This was the old [README.md](Old-Source/README.md)

## New Approach using Solely AWS

### Utilities

- Terraform
- S3
- DynamoDB
- Lambda
- Python

## Easy To Run

`terraform init`

`terraform fmt`

`terraform plan`

`terraform apply -auto-approve`

## Next Todo

- CI/CD
